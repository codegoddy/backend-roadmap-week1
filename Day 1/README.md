# 🧠 Day 1 — Python CLI Projects

This repo documents my progress on Day 1 of the **14-Week Backend + DevOps Developer Roadmap**.

---

## ✅ What I Learned Today

- Python conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for` and `while`)
- Functions with parameters and return values
- Type hints (`def my_function(x: int) -> str`)
- Error handling using `try/except`
- Lists, tuples, and dictionaries for storing structured data
- How to design and build interactive CLI apps from scratch

## 📝 Why This Matters

These beginner-friendly CLI projects helped me:

- Practice logic building and error handling.
- Understand how to collect and store user input
- See how simple terminal apps can simulate real backend behavior
- Get ready for API-building with Flask and Django in the coming weeks

## 📅 Next: Day 2 — Python OOP

Tomorrow I’ll dive into object-oriented programming with:

- Classes.
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation

...to prepare for model-based backend development.
