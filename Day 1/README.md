# 🧠 Day 1 — Python CLI Projects

This repo documents my progress on Day 1 of the **14-Week Backend + DevOps Developer Roadmap**.

---

## ✅ What I Learned Today

- Python conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for` and `while`)
- Functions with parameters and return values
- Type hints (`def my_function(x: int) -> str`)
- Error handling using `try/except`
- Lists and tuples for storing structured data
- How to design and build CLI apps from scratch

---

## 🚀 Projects Built

### 1. `study_planner.py`

A motivational study tracker that asks for your goal and hours planned, then encourages you based on your input.

**Features:**
- Input your name, study goal, and hours planned
- Custom motivational message based on time
- (Bonus) Logs your goal and time into a file `study_log.txt`

---

### 2. `expense_tracker.py`

A command-line app that allows you to record your daily expenses and get a summary of everything you spent.

**Features:**
- Input expense description and amount
- Handles invalid inputs with `try/except`
- Calculates and displays total spent

---

### 3. `task_timer.py`

A productivity tracker that logs how much time you’ve spent on daily tasks.

**Features:**
- Input your name and number of tasks
- For each task, input what you worked on and how long (in minutes)
- Displays a summary and motivational message based on total time

## 📝 Why This Matters

These beginner-friendly CLI projects helped me:
- Practice logic building and error handling
- Understand how to collect and store user input
- See how simple terminal apps can simulate real backend behavior
- Get ready for API-building with Flask and Django in the coming weeks

## 📅 Next: Day 2 — Python OOP

Tomorrow I’ll dive into object-oriented programming with:
- Classes
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation

...to prepare for model-based backend development.
